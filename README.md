## ## Project Goal 🎯

The main goal of this assignment is to design and build an automated system—essentially an AI agent that intelligently segments online shoppers who have abandoned their shopping carts. The final output should be an actionable strategy that a marketing team can use to run targeted campaigns to win these customers back and recover lost revenue.

## ## The Core Problem: Cart Abandonment

For any e-commerce business, cart abandonment is a major issue. A customer shows clear intent to buy by adding items to their cart but then leaves without completing the purchase. A generic "you left something in your cart" email is often ineffective because different customers leave for different reasons. The solution is to group, or **segment**, these users based on their characteristics to send them more relevant and persuasive messages.

## ## The Guiding Framework: MECE

To ensure the segmentation is logical and complete, the assignment requires us to use the **MECE** framework.

* **MECE** stands for **Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**.
* **Mutually Exclusive**: Every user must belong to **only one** segment. This prevents sending a customer conflicting messages (e.g., both a 10% off coupon and a free shipping offer).
* **Collectively Exhaustive**: Every single user in our target group **must belong to a segment**. This ensures no potential customer is overlooked in the marketing strategy.

## ## The Technical Tasks: A Step-by-Step Breakdown

The assignment is broken down into five main technical tasks:

**1. Define the Universe**
The first step is to filter the entire dataset to get our target audience. This is defined as all users who have abandoned a shopping cart within the last 7 days.

**2. Create MECE Segments**
Using a decision-tree-inspired approach, we must partition the universe into smaller, more specific groups. This is done by creating rules based on key user features like **Average Order Value (AOV)**, **engagement score**, and **profitability score**.

**3. Apply Constraints**
Marketing campaigns need audiences of a practical size. The script must enforce minimum and maximum segment sizes (e.g., between 500 and 20,000 users). This involves automatically **merging** segments that are too small and **splitting** segments that are too large.

**4. Compute Audience Scores**
To help marketers prioritize their efforts, we must calculate a weighted **"Overall Score"** for each segment. This score is a combination of several dimensions, including the segment's conversion potential, profitability, and size.

**5. Output the Strategy**
The final step is to generate the deliverables. The script must output a clean and easy-to-read strategy file (in CSV and JSON format) that lists each segment, its size, the exact rules used to define it, and its scores.

## ## The Final Solution: Key Features

The solution we built in the `Mainass.ipynb` notebook accomplishes all these tasks with several advanced features:

* **Technology Stack**: It uses standard, open-source Python libraries, primarily **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
* **Hybrid Thresholds**: Instead of using fixed numbers, the rules are based on a mix of data-driven **quantiles** and **business-defined minimums**, making the system both adaptive and practical.
* **Guaranteed MECE Logic**: The use of the `numpy.select` function ensures the segmentation is mathematically guaranteed to be Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive.
* **Automated Constraint Handling**: The script automatically merges and splits segments to ensure they are always a practical size for marketers.
* **High Interpretability**: A key feature is the automatic generation of a **"Rules Applied"** column, which provides a human-readable explanation of each segment, making the output immediately actionable for the marketing team.

## ## Instructions to Run 🚀

The script is designed as a Google Colab notebook (`Mainass.ipynb`) for easy execution and review.

1.  **Open in Google Colab**: Upload and open the `Mainass.ipynb` file in your Google Colab environment.
2.  **Execute the Notebook**: The easiest way to run the entire pipeline is to go to the menu and select **"Runtime" -> "Run all"**. This will execute each cell in order.
3.  **Observe the Output**: As the cells run, you will see printed logs confirming each step, such as "Generating mock data...", "Defining universe...", and the final strategy table displayed at the end.
4.  **Find the Deliverables**: The script saves the output files to the Colab virtual machine. To access them:
    * Click the **folder icon (📁)** on the left-hand sidebar.
    * Open the new folder named `submission`.
    * Inside, you will find `segment_strategy.csv`, `segment_strategy.json`, and the `README.md` file. You can download them from there.

## ## Future Improvements 💡

To transition this framework into a production-grade segmentation system, the following enhancements can be prioritized:

A/B Testing Integration – Directly connect segments to experimentation platforms to validate campaign effectiveness and measure true incremental lift.

Predictive Scoring Models – Replace heuristic lift estimates with machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, gradient boosting) trained on historical data to predict conversion probability with higher accuracy.

Automated Re-segmentation – Schedule the pipeline to refresh segments (e.g., weekly) so they adapt dynamically to changing customer behavior.

Personalization at Scale – Sync outputs with a Customer Data Platform (CDP) or marketing automation tools to drive personalized offers, creatives, and experiences at the user level.

Automated Visualization – Generate dashboards and plots for segment sizes, engagement, and scores, providing marketers with an instant, interpretable view of audience health.
